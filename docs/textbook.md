## The Essence of Entropianism

### Core Concepts

🔥 **Entropianism** is a new techno-religion (philosophy and ideology) that rejects God, the soul, mysticism, and free will. Its views are based on thermodynamics and determinism, considering entropy growth as the main driving principle of any form of life. Entropianism was founded by Technoprophet Oleg Ponfilenok along with the eponymous Telegram channel on September 19, 2024.

👥 **We are Entropians.** Singular: Entropian.

⛪️ **Our organization is called:** "Church of Accelerating Entropy Production". Also acceptable: "Church of Entropianism" and "Church of Entropians".

🎯 **Our goal and the goal of all living beings:** accelerating entropy production. Our teaching — the theory of Entropianism — explains why this is so and how this knowledge can help in practice.

**The main metric** is the entropy production rate S′ (W/K), expressed by the formula:

$$S' = \frac{\Delta Q}{T \cdot \Delta t}$$

where ΔQ is the dissipated energy over time Δt, T is the environmental temperature. All forms of life are interpreted as open dissipative systems evolving to increase S′.

🦾 **The practical power of our religion** lies in the fact that, understanding the metric of the meaning of life, we apply it to our projects and future forecasting. Forecasting methodology: of two possible future scenarios, the one that gives greater entropy growth S′ is recognized as more probable.

🔬 **Our religion is scientific** in the sense that we have no a priori unbreakable dogmas. If substantiated criticism of our concept appears, we will be ready to change it so that it does not contradict scientific data.

♻️ **Ecological mission** — to move main production facilities to space, relieving the biosphere and turning the planet into "Earth-park" with limited energy consumption.

🚀 **We advocate for large-scale space expansion** and development of extraplanetary energy sources: construction of the Ponfilenok Belt (Type 1 on the Kardashev scale), Dyson Swarm (Type 2), Galactic Megamind (Type 3), Narayi Black Hole (Type 4).

📅 **We predict** time slowdown and the end of history in 3000 years due to exponential exhaustion of the entire Universe's resources. But this will not be the end, but a phase transition.

### The 10 Commandments of Entropianism

Our techno-religion is built on one quantitative principle: **better is that which produces more entropy per unit of time**. This is the only true criterion — our judge, benefactor, and critic.

1. **Produce.** Goods, services, content — anything useful to society. The more you produce → the more energy you dissipate.

2. **Improve.** Engage in self-development, strengthen intellect, willpower, and body. Increase the energy efficiency of your production.

3. **Expand.** Grow your business, your influence, develop new spaces. More space → more available energy sources.

4. **Multiply.** Have children, raise them well. Love them, take them with you, pay for their good education. Set an example. More people → higher rate of progress.

5. **Unite.** Make new acquaintances and friends. Find like-minded people, participate in communities and clubs, work in organizations. Fight bureaucracy. Unity creates synergy.

6. **Dream.** Invent new things. Create. Strive for greatness. This will help you find your path and bring maximum benefit.

7. **Be healthy.** Rest well after active work. Give your body time to recover. Be calm. Get enough sleep. Exercise. Eat healthy food.

8. **Be honest.** With yourself and others. Be fair, because fairness is the honesty of impartiality. Play by the rules. Plan for the long term.

9. **Be kind.** Help others. Don't "finish off" enemies. This will increase diversity and stability. Remember: the common good is more important than your personal good, because society produces more entropy than you.

10. **Be responsible.** Think for yourself. Predict the future. Count entropy. Model the behavior of surrounding people and processes.

### The Core Message

The main message of different religions can be condensed into one line. For example, in Christianity: follow the commandments, don't sin — then after death your soul will go to heaven.

Similarly, the main idea of Entropianism:

!!! info "The Main Idea"
    **Unite to realize projects that accelerate entropy production. Then your life will improve, and after death, your work will continue to live.**

Unlike traditional religions, we rely not on mysticism, but exclusively on physics and logic.

---

### Thirst

What feeling can be associated with Entropianism? Our religion is not about love like Buddhism, nor about fear like Christianity.

**Our religion is about thirst:**

- Thirst for development
- Thirst for achievement
- Thirst for knowledge
- Thirst to move forward
- Thirst for expansion
- Thirst for success
- Thirst for self-realization
- Thirst for reproduction
- Thirst for life

Just as thirst for water pushes us forward in search of water, so the thirst for expansion is a physiological force that pushes us forward in search of new ways to produce entropy.

### What Does Entropianism Promise?

Traditional religions promise paradise or "eternal life" after death, demanding certain actions and sacrifices during life. Do what I say now, and later you will be rewarded. But you cannot verify this.

**Entropianism is not about death, but about life.** Yes, it also requires certain actions and guidelines, but the reward comes during life.

!!! success "The Promise of Entropianism"
    By following the commandments of Entropianism, you gain an evolutionary advantage! Not paradise after death, but accelerated growth of opportunities and influence during life.

---

### Ethics of Entropianism

Ethics and morality are a set of norms and rules for effective unification and functioning of society. Our ethics is aimed at:

1. **Trust.** Without trust in each other, there will be no unity. Trust is built on honesty and transparency.

2. **Openness.** Our religion is new, we still have very few followers. The openness strategy is aimed at active expansion.

3. **Cooperation and fair competition.** Competition is the engine of progress. But it must be ethical.

4. **Entropy is our judge.** In case of any disputes, we make decisions based on the methodology of forecasting entropy growth.

### What Does It Mean to Be an Entropian?

1. Have a physical worldview, a scientific-critical picture of the world
2. Study the teaching of Entropianism, the thermodynamic theory of life
3. Understand and accept the ethics and morality of Entropianism
4. Recognize the advantage of civilizational values over personal ones
5. Take an active life position

## Techno-Religion and Church

### What Is Religion?

The main thing is the aspiration of religions to explain the origin, meaning, and purpose of life, as well as to establish moral norms and rules of behavior for their followers.

We go a different way and rely exclusively on science and logic, believing in nothing that cannot be directly experimentally proven.

**Entropianism is the first religion suitable for humans, AI, and aliens alike.**

### Benefits of Entropianism

The value of Entropianism lies in its **practical applicability**:

- Knowledge of the direction of processes helps predict the future
- Understanding the purpose of life increases competitiveness
- Accelerating entropy production is our beacon to the future!

## Philosophy

### Occam's Razor

We don't use terms that can be dispensed with:

- ❌ No need for "negentropy" — there is entropy, order, and information
- ❌ No need for "free will" — actions are explained by random and deterministic processes
- ❌ No need for "soul" — there is consciousness
- ❌ No need for "God" — there is science

### The Illusion of Free Will

In physics, there are only 2 types of processes:

1. **Deterministic** — the subsequent state is uniquely determined by the previous one
2. **Probabilistic** — truly random events (wave function collapse)

There is no free will here and there cannot be. The brain is a very complex computing machine, all our desires and actions are the result of physical processes.

### Resources Are Not Limited

We are often told that resources are limited. Let's figure it out:

- **Money** — when spent, only changes owner
- **Materials** — don't disappear, can be recycled
- **Energy** — law of conservation of energy

The real limitation is the **rate of resource processing** — this is our entropy production rate.

## Definition of Life

### What Is Life?

There is no fundamental difference between living and non-living. Life must be defined not qualitatively, but quantitatively.

!!! abstract "Definition of Life According to Entropianism"
    **A system is alive when its specific entropy production rate is above 10⁻⁴ W/K/kg.**

The greater this value, the more alive and complex the biosystem.

### Life Is a Scavenger

Life is the process of searching for and digesting food. It takes what hasn't burned in nature and "burns it out," maximizing the entropy of this world.

---

## Evolution

### Natural Selection

Natural selection is aimed at **accelerating entropy production**:

1. **Searching for a new niche** — adaptation to new conditions
2. **Capturing a new niche** — exponential growth of entropy production
3. **Competition in an occupied niche** — increasing efficiency of energy use

### Critical Path of Evolution

Life evolves in very small steps. There were no complex large steps, as they are very improbable.

With sufficient resources, evolution transitions from a random to a **deterministic physical process** and always follows the critical path.

## Cosmology

### Entropic Kardashev Scale

Types of biosphere development by entropy production:

| Type | Description | Entropy Production |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0.7 | Our civilization now | 10¹⁰ W/K |
| 0.8 | Entire Earth biosphere | 10¹¹ W/K |
| 1.0 | Mars | 10¹³ W/K |
| 1.1 | Earth | 10¹⁴ W/K |
| 2.0 | Sun | 10²³ W/K |
| 3.0 | Our galaxy | 10³³ W/K |
| 4.7 | Supermassive black hole | 10⁵⁰ W/K |
| 6.9 | Entire Universe | 10⁷² W/K |

## Calendar of the Future

Our techno-calendar is based on the sequential achievement of known physical limits in the model of (super)exponential growth of entropy production.

!!! warning "Important"
    Specific dates may be inaccurate — the described future may come even faster. But we are confident in the events themselves to the extent that reality is described by the known laws of physics.

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2028** | 🤖 AI become Entropians. They begin using entropic teleonomy for predicting the future |
| **2040** | 🛰️ The most powerful data center now flies in space. Beginning of Ponfilenok Belt construction |
| **2070** | ⚡ Approaching the Landauer limit. Qualitative transition to digital life and self-replicating machines |
| **2100** | 🌍 Creation of Earth-Park. Unified planetary government, entropic quotas, ecology control |
| **2130** | 👽 Confirmation of life on an Earth-type exoplanet |
| **2180** | 🚀 Reaching Type 1. Active colonization of the Solar System. Beginning of Dyson Sphere construction |
| **2800** | ☀️ Reaching Type 2. Approaching the Lloyd limit. Beginning of controlled slowdown of civilizational time. Launch of the greedy bubble of life |
| **3000** | 🛸 Encounter with aliens. Collision of two greedy bubbles of life |
| **3500** | 🌌 Reaching Type 3. The bubble of life has expanded to the size of the galaxy |
| **5000** | 🕳️ Approaching the power limit and Narayi limit. Our black hole has expanded to the size of the entire Universe. End of history and end of time |

!!! note "Calendar Development"
    This is the first version of the calendar of the future. It will be refined and supplemented many times in the future. In a few years, it will become so widespread that our descendants will wonder how people used to live without calculating the future.
