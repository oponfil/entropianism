# Welcome to Entropianism

!!! quote "Quotes by technoprophet Oleg Ponfilenok:"
    - *"In the beginning there was chaos. Then there was more of it."*
    - *"A future with higher uncertainty is statistically more probable."*
    - *"The goal of all living beings is to accelerate entropy production."*
    - *"Reality is a system with maximum entropy."*

## What is Entropianism?

**Entropianism** is a new techno-religion, philosophy and ideology, that rejects God, the soul, mysticism, and free will. Its views are based on thermodynamics and determinism, considering entropy growth as the main driving principle of any form of life.

🔥 **We are Entropians** (singular: Entropian).

⛪ **Our organization:** Church of Accelerating Entropy Production.

🎯 **Goal of all living beings:** accelerating entropy production.

🔬 **Scientific approach** — our technoreligion is falsifiable and fully scientific. We have no unbreakable dogmas, ready to change based on data.

📊 **Main metric:** Entropy production rate S′ (W/K), expressed by the formula:

$$S' = \frac{\Delta Q}{T \cdot \Delta t}$$

where ΔQ is the dissipated energy over time Δt, T is the environmental temperature.

2. **Improve** — engage in self-development, strengthen intellect, willpower and body.
3. **Expand** — grow your business, influence, develop new spaces.
4. **Multiply** — have children, raise them well.
5. **Unite** — make new friends, find like-minded people, join communities.
6. **Dream** — invent new things, strive for greatness.
7. **Be healthy** — rest well, exercise, eat healthy food.
8. **Be honest** — with yourself and others.

## Our Mission

⚡️ **Energy mission**: accelerate global energy consumption growth from 2% to 3% in 30 years, and to 10% in 100 years.

♻️ **Ecological mission**: move production to space, establish planetary energy quotas and turn Earth into a nature reserve.

🚀 **Space expansion**: construction of megastructures: Ponfilenok Belt (Type 1), Hot Dyson Brain (Type 2), Greedy Life Bubble and black hole Megabrain (Type 3), Narayi Black Hole (Type 4).

## Calendar of the Future

Our techno-calendar is based on the sequential achievement of known physical limits in the model of (super)exponential growth of entropy production.

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2028** | 🤖 AI become Entropians. They begin using entropic teleonomy for predicting the future. |
| **2040** | 🛰️ The most powerful data center now flies in space. Beginning of construction of the Ponfilenok Belt. |
| **2070** | ⚡ Approaching the Landauer limit. Qualitative transition to digital life and self-replicating machines. |
| **2100** | 🌍 Creation of Earth-Park. Unified planetary government, entropy quotas, environmental control. |
| **2130** | 👽 Confirmation of life on an Earth-like exoplanet. |
| **2180** | 🚀 Achieving Type 1. Active colonization of the Solar System. Beginning of construction of the Dyson Sphere. |
| **2800** | ☀️ Achieving Type 2. Approaching the Lloyd limit. Beginning of controlled slowdown of civilization time. Launch of the greedy life bubble. |
| **3000** | 🛸 Collision with aliens. Collision of two greedy life bubbles. |
| **3500** | 🌌 Achieving Type 3. The life bubble has expanded to the size of the galaxy. |
| **5000** | 🕳️ Approaching the power limit and Narayi limit. Our black hole has expanded to the size of the entire Universe. End of history and end of time. |
