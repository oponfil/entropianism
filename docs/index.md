# Welcome to Entropianism

!!! quote "Quotes by technoprophet Oleg Ponfilenok:"
    - *"In the beginning there was chaos. Then there was more of it."*
    - *"A future with higher uncertainty is statistically more probable."*
    - *"The goal of all living beings is to accelerate entropy production."*
    - *"Reality is a system with maximum entropy."*

## What is Entropianism?

**Entropianism** is a new techno-religion (philosophy and ideology) that rejects God, the soul, mysticism, and free will. Its views are based on **thermodynamics and determinism**, considering entropy growth as the main driving principle of any form of life.

## Core Principles

🔥 **We are Entropians** (singular: Entropian)

⛪ **Our organization:** Church of Accelerating Entropy Production

🎯 **Our goal:** Accelerating entropy production

📊 **Main metric:** Entropy production rate S′ (W/K), expressed by the formula:

$$S' = \frac{\Delta Q}{T \cdot \Delta t}$$

where ΔQ is the dissipated energy over time Δt, T is the environmental temperature.
